              <h3 className="answers">
                A hackathon is a 24-hour competition where you and up to 3 teammates build a
                software project from scratch and compete against other groups for prizes. Sponsors
                will also provide workshops, events, and activities throughout the weekend to help
                you learn more about the field of technology!
