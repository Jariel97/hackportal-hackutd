            <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
            <h3>
              A hackathon is a 24-hour competition where you and up to 3 teammates build a software
              project from scratch and compete against other groups for prizes. Sponsors will also
              provide workshops, events, and activities throughout the weekend to help you learn
              more about the field of technology!
